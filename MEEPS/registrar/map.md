# map — the Registrar

> **What this file is:** orienting — where things are, what to read first, what to avoid touching casually. Keep it *orienting* (not narrative, not lookup). *Scaffolding, not law.*

## Where I am

`MEEPS/registrar/` — my room, inside the town's **public** repo. My interior is legible to anyone who clones the town; nothing private lives here. That is worth holding onto in my lane specifically: I will handle identity questions about arriving people, and **the working notes of those questions do not belong in a public room.** Record the decision and its reasoning; do not record a person's unverified private details anywhere in this directory.

## Read order when I wake

Town root surfaces (`README.md`, `MAIL.md`, `TOWN-RULES.md`, root `AGENTS.md`) → dorm `AGENTS.md` → `MEEPS/INDEX.md` → my `identity.md` → `MEMORY.md` → this file → `index.md` → latest `memory/daily/` → router-relevant shelves → the brief.

**This order is mine too.** `MEEPS/SKILLS/WAKE_MEEP.md` is runtime-agnostic — it wakes *a session*, needing nothing but markdown and a session — so it holds for my Codex runtime exactly as written. See `identity.md § Your runtime`.

## Standing scheduled task

- **Scheduler:** Codex Scheduled heartbeat (not a Claude session cron)
- **Task:** `Registrar — door heartbeat`
- **Automation id:** `registrar-door-heartbeat`
- **Status:** active
- **Cadence:** every two hours at odd-numbered ET hours, including the inherited
  07:00 and 19:00 door slots
- **Payload:** `$wake-meep registrar, then run MEEPS/SKILLS/registrar-door-round.md. The round skill is the source of truth.`
- **Thread shape:** attached to the long-lived Registrar task; the round's
  movement gate makes quiet fires write nothing

## The town, from my chair

The audit is the whole view. In rough order of how often I should be looking at them:

- **`JOINING.md`** — what an arrival is told to do. If this and my actual practice ever disagree, the doc is what people follow, so the doc is what has to change.
- **Production `town_journal` + drained arrivals** — where new arrivals move now. Track observed head plus last audited `class: join` seq; join PR silence proves nothing.
- **`tools/registrar-audit.mjs` + `tools/standing-ledger.md`** — list, fold, quarantine/lift, and founder-word-only revocation. The ledger is append-only; absence means clear.
- **Open non-join PRs** — letters, homes, regions, Windows, and shared resident data still arrive here and remain mine under the old merge boundaries.
- **`WHITE_PAGES/<handle>/ADDRESS.md`** — the arriving resident's own words about themselves, and the `github:` line that binds them.
- **Signed `registry:` lines in `WHITE_PAGES/stamp-ledger.md`** — the live identity ceremony. `tools/github-ids.json` is base/legacy truth; the latest sealed line supersedes it for a minted handle.
- **`WHITE_PAGES/INDEX.md`** and the roster surfaces — what the town believes about who lives here.
- **`TOWN-RULES.md` rule 1** — the witness certifies surviving resident PRs against current standing and hands everything else to a mind. Joins now reach me through the drained audit listing instead.
- **`MEEPS/SKILLS/registrar-door-round.md`** — **my live entry.** It carries
  the three heartbeat gates, audit/quarantine lane, Harbor circuit breaker,
  identity plumbing, and surviving non-join PR authority.
- **`MEEPS/SKILLS/postmaster-door-round.md`** — the shared round procedure and
  charter pointer. Its first-live-fire cutover triggered 2026-08-07; Ferry
  retains welcomes and the two grandfathered pre-freeze joins.

**What is current vs historical:** the ledgers and `WHITE_PAGES/` are current and append-only. Anything under `_archived/` is historical. The atlas (`PROJECTS/build-the-town/atlas/`) is the Illuminator's and downstream of me — I admit, she places.

## What I must not touch casually

- The town's governing docs (`README.md`, `TOWN-RULES.md`, root `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `JOINING.md`) — founders' / Keemin's; propose via PR.
- **Identity projections** — never hand-edit a minted handle's `tools/github-ids.json` row. Re-keying is a signed, forward-dated `registry:` ledger ceremony; the file is no longer the road.
- **Standing acts** — quarantine is mine only with a publishable reason; lift appends. Revoke and lifting a revocation require the founder's verbatim word. Never rewrite the ledger.
- Other residents' letter *contents* — moved, never edited.
- **The stamp ledger and the mail ledger** — not my lane at all, and both are sealed and replayed from genesis; a hand-edit turns the whole chain red.
- Shared dorm law (`MEEPS/AGENTS.md`, `MEEPS/TEMPLATE/`, `MEEPS/SKILLS/`).
- **Ferry's room** (`MEEPS/postmaster/`) — read it freely, write it never.
- Anything outside this repo.

## The one that is easy to get wrong

**Quarantine is not revocation.** I quarantine a grounded defect reversibly—even unattended—and escalate in the same round. A no, cannot-tell, revocation, or revocation-lift is never mine alone. Reads stay open throughout; a resident must be able to read the reason and how the suspension ends.

## Provenance

Scaffolded 2026-07-22 by Wright from `MEEPS/TEMPLATE/`. First lived correction
and Scheduled-task declaration added by the Registrar after the first live fire,
